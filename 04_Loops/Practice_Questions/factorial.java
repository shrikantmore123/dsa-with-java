/*
Write a program to find the factorialof any number entered by the user.
(Hint : factorial of a number n = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * (n-3) * ...... * 1 and exists for positive numbers only. 
We write factorial as n! So, factorial of 0! = 1, 1! = 1, 2! = 2, 3! = 6, 4! = 24 and so on.
Note - Please do not confuse factorial with NOT EQUAL TO operator, they are not the same)
